# Preparation

Let's prepare for DataWars `2023` ðŸš€

## 1. Environment

Set up an programming env which is quickly accessable and in a language you are confortable in.

I suggest Python, but feel free to use any language you like.
There are different ways to set up Python. I use Python3.11 and Poetry as depedenency manager. Feel free to copy [my setup](https://github.com/3lLobo/starshipToml#python).

## 2. Challenges

Assuming it is going to be similar to last year, we will have to solve coding problems the first part of the day.
They come in the structure of a problem statement and data.
The solution is a combination of numbers or letters which have to be submitted.
How you solve the problem is up to [you](https://chat.openai.com/).

I uploaded an example of such a problem. Open the [page](./practice01.html), read the instructions and see if you can get to the correct answer. Use [`input`](./input) as data.

> Document your approach! This will make you more efficient and help you to remember what you did. We will talk it through on Monday.


## 3. Approach

> Do not reinvent the wheel!

Chances are incredibly low that you are the first one to solve a problem. 
Yet I catch myself doing it at least once a day ðŸ™„

It's good to specify sources to look up approaches beforehand.
This could be:
1. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
1. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
2. [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)
4. [AOC solutions](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code)
5. [Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/)

Python code specific sources:
1. [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
2. [Geesforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/)
3. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
4. [Python Patterns](https://www.python-patterns.guide/)
